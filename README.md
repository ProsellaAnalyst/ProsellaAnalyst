# Welcome to My GitHub

Hi, I’m **Daniella Shalom** — also known as **ProsellaAnalyst / Analyst Prosella**.

This repository isn’t a collection of dashboards.  
It’s a collection of **decisions shaped by data**.

I work at the intersection of analytics and strategy, using data to surface risks, uncover opportunities, and recommend **what should happen next**.

## About Me

**Role:** Decision Intelligence Analyst  

I focus on:
- Translating complex data into clear business actions  
- Explaining performance in a way non-technical leaders understand  
- Designing insights that reduce uncertainty and guide decisions  

If a dashboard doesn’t influence a decision, it isn’t finished.

## What You’ll Find Here

- Decision-focused analytics projects  
- Business dashboards explained in plain language  
- Strategic recommendations grounded in data  
- Case-style breakdowns of:
  - What the numbers mean

Every project answers one core question:
